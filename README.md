Here's a suggested README file content for your "Disease Prediction" project to upload on GitHub:

**Disease Prediction System**
**Overview**
The Disease Prediction System is a machine learning-based application that predicts potential diseases based on user-provided symptoms. This project utilizes various classification algorithms to analyze and classify diseases, providing a recommendation system that includes precautions, medications, workout suggestions, and diet plans for the predicted disease.

**Features**
Disease Prediction: Predicts the disease based on symptoms provided by the user.
Recommendation System: Provides recommendations for precautions, medications, workouts, and diets for the predicted disease.
Model Training: Utilizes multiple machine learning algorithms, including Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, K-Neighbors, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
User-Friendly Interface: Prompts users to enter their symptoms and returns detailed information about the predicted disease.
**Technologies Used**
Python
Pandas
Scikit-Learn
NumPy
Pickle (for model serialization)
Dataset
The model is trained using a dataset (Training.csv) containing various symptoms and their corresponding diseases. Additional CSV files provide descriptions, precautions, medications, diets, and workout plans related to diseases.
Enter your symptoms when prompted, separated by commas.
For example:
itching, skin_rash, nodal_skin_eruptions
The system will output:

Predicted disease
Description of the disease
Recommended precautions
Suggested medications
Recommended workouts
Suggested diets
